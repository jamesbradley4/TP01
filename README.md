Team 1 Project 1
Live Applied Exercise 6.6.9

We will discuss:

- Objectives: What problem are we trying to solve?
- Dataset: Is this a real dataset? simulated dataset? Briefly explain the Xs and Ys
- Explore the dataset: Key highlights - Correlations? summary statistics? Plots?
- Feature engineering: Do you have to transform variables? log/scale/polynomials?
- Train/test the model: Emphasize the new library/command you're introducing here, and key tuning parameters (e.g., lambda)
- Evaluate the model: What metrics are you using? Are you tuning any parameters? Plots?
